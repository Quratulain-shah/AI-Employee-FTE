- **Media:** Images/GIFs/polls don't count toward limit

### Audience Characteristics

## Tweet Best Practices

### Optimal Tweet Length
**Sweet Spot: 71-100 characters**
- Gets 17% more engagement than longer tweets
- Quick to read, easy to retweet
- Mobile-friendly (most users on mobile)

**Under 71 characters:** Too short, may seem low-effort
**100-280 characters:** Fine, but loses some engagement
**Over 200 characters:** Lowest engagement (thread instead)

### Hashtag Strategy (Critical Difference)
**Twitter: 1-2 hashtags maximum**
- Unlike Instagram (5-10), Twitter users avoid hashtag-heavy tweets
- Hashtags don't significantly boost reach on Twitter
- Focus on content quality > hashtag quantity

**When to Use Hashtags:**
- Trending topics (#AI #TechNews)
- Event hashtags (#SXSW #TechConf2026)
- Branded hashtag (#BuildInPublic #YourBrand)

**When to Skip Hashtags:**
- Hot takes (looks more authentic without)
- Replies/conversations
- Threads (use only on first/last tweet)

## Tweet Templates

### Template 1: Quick Insight/Tip

**Purpose:** Share valuable knowledge concisely

**Structure (71-100 chars):**
```
[Insight or tip in one sentence]

[Optional: #hashtag]
```

**Example:**
```
The best code is code you don't have to write.

Automate first, optimize later.
```

### Template 2: Question Tweet

**Purpose:** Spark conversation, increase replies

**Structure:**
```
[Setup or context - 1 line]

[Direct question]
```

**Example:**
```
Been automating my workflow for 6 months now.

What's the first thing you'd automate if you could?
```
*105 characters*

---

### Template 3: Hot Take

**Purpose:** Controversial opinion, start discussion

**Structure:**
```
[Bold statement or unpopular opinion]

[Optional: Brief justification]
```

**Example:**
```
Hot take: Most "productivity" tools make you less productive.

They add complexity without solving the real problem: lack of focus.
```
*135 characters*

**Note:** No hashtags on hot takes (more authentic)

---

### Template 4: Numbered List (Mini)

**Purpose:** Quick actionable list

**Structure:**
```
[Topic]:

1. [Item 1]
2. [Item 2]
3. [Item 3]
```

**Example:**
```
3 automation mistakes I made:

1. Automating before understanding the process
2. Over-engineering simple tasks
3. Not documenting what I automated

Don't be me 6 months ago.
```
*159 characters*

---

### Template 5: Quote + Commentary

**Purpose:** Share wisdom with your perspective

**Structure:**
```
"[Quote]"

[Your take or application - 1-2 sentences]
```

**Example:**
```
"Automate the boring stuff."

Best advice I ever followed. Freed up 10 hours/week by scripting repetitive tasks.

What would you do with 10 extra hours? 🤔
```
*156 characters*

---

### Template 6: Announcement

**Purpose:** Share news, launches, milestones

**Structure:**
```
[Announcement or news]

[Brief detail or benefit]

[CTA or link]
```

**Example:**
```
We just launched our AI Employee setup service 🚀

Done-for-you automation: emails, social, tasks.

DM "AUTOMATE" if you want to save 10+ hours/week.
```
*153 characters*

---

## Thread Structure

**When to Use Threads:**
- Topic requires > 280 characters meaningfully
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Storytelling with narrative
- In-depth analysis
- Listicles (5+ items)

**Optimal Thread Length:** 5-7 tweets
**Maximum Recommended:** 12 tweets (longer = fewer readers)

### Thread Opening (Tweet 1)

**Must Include:**
1. Hook (first 5 words critical)
2. Promise of value (what they'll learn)
3. Thread indicator (🧵 or "A thread:" or "Let me explain 👇")

**Example:**
```
The 5 Claude Code commands that saved me 100 hours this month.

Actual automation, not just tips.

A thread 🧵
```

### Thread Body (Tweets 2-N)

**Format:**
- Number clearly: "1/" "2/" "3/" etc.
- One point per tweet
- 150-250 characters per tweet (sweet spot)
- Natural flow between tweets

**Example Tweet 2:**
```
1/ Email Auto-Responder

Set up Claude to read incoming emails, draft contextual replies, and queue them for your approval.

Went from 2 hours/day on email to 15 minutes.
```

### Thread Conclusion (Final Tweet)

**Must Include:**
1. Summary or key takeaway
2. CTA (follow, retweet, comment)
3. Optional: Link to resource

**Example:**
```
7/ That's it. 5 commands, 100 hours saved.

## Writing Style

### Voice & Tone
- **Conversational:** Like talking to a colleague
- **Direct:** No fluff, get to the point
- **Authentic:** Show personality, not corporate speak
- **Confident:** Have an opinion, but not arrogant

### Formatting Tips

**Use Line Breaks:**
```
This is hard to read because it's all one block and Twitter users scroll fast so they'll skip this.
```

vs.

```
This is easier to read.

Line breaks help.

Short sentences work.
```

**Sentence Fragments Are OK:**
```
Automation? Game changer.
Productivity? 10x improvement.
Worth it? Absolutely.
```

**Avoid:**
- All caps (looks aggressive)
- Excessive punctuation (!!!)
- Corporate jargon (synergy, leverage, circle back)
- Long words when short ones work

---

## Engagement Tactics

### Get More Replies
- Ask direct questions
- End with "What's your experience?"

## What to Avoid

### Content to Skip
❌ Overly promotional (every tweet is "buy this")
❌ Generic motivational quotes (without your take)
❌ Vague-booking ("Excited for what's coming!")
❌ All hashtags, no substance
❌ Threads that should be blog posts (20+ tweets)

### Engagement Bait (Against Twitter Rules)
❌ "RT for X, Like for Y"
❌ "Follow me and I'll follow back"
❌ "Tag 3 friends"
❌ Artificially inflating engagement

### Technical Mistakes
❌ More than 2 hashtags (looks spammy)
❌ @mentioning unrelated accounts
❌ Tweeting same content repeatedly
❌ Buying followers/engagement
❌ Using banned automation tools

## Twitter Algorithm Factors

**What Boosts Reach:**
1. Early engagement (first 15 min)
2. Retweets with comments
3. Replies (especially threads of replies)
4. Profile clicks
5. Link clicks
6. Media (images, videos, GIFs)

**What Hurts Reach:**
- Low engagement rate
- Links to certain external sites
- Controversial content (depends on network)
- Mutes/blocks after seeing tweet

**Pro Tip:** Twitter shows your tweets first to your most engaged followers. If they engage, reach expands.

## Content Mix Recommendation

**Weekly Balance:**
- 40% Value/Insights (tips, learnings)
- 30% Engagement (questions, discussions)
- 20% Personal/Behind-the-Scenes
- 10% Promotional (services, offers)

**Thread Distribution:**
- 1 thread per week (max 2)
- Threads for tutorials, stories, deep dives
- Single tweets for everything else

---

## Analytics to Track

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Impressions:** How many times tweet was seen
2. **Engagement Rate:** (Engagements / Impressions) × 100
3. **Link Clicks:** If tweet has link
4. **Retweets:** Shares (most valuable)
5. **Replies:** Conversation depth
6. **Profile Visits:** How many checked your profile

**Benchmarks:**
- Engagement Rate: 1-3% average, 5%+ excellent
