## Content
Join us live <https://luma.com/eo4n4q8k> as we add Stripe invoicing to a 
custom time tracking application. We’ll remix an existing Replit app then add 
custom invoicing tools using the new Stripe Connect integration.

What we're covering:


 * Remix a Replit project: How to remix a project and configure existing 
integrations
 * Stripe Connect integration: How to integrate Stripe into an existing web app
 * Feature refinements: Working through the small details and adding a bit of 
polish

What you'll get:


 * Hands on experience working with Agent
 * Technical deep dive as we work with the Stripe Connect integrations in 
real-time
 * Live commentary on what the Agent is doing and how it all works
 * Real-time Q&A

If you’re interested in adding payments or working with Stripe inside of your 
Replit projects then this is the stream for you.
