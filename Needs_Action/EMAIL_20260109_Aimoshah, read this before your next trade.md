**Hi ,**

=========================





This is a **big heads-up** if you trade with us now—or plan to.



Because a bunch of the things you’ve been asking (or yelling) for… just quietly went live inside E8.



● Let’s start with the stuff already running today:





- News trading is now allowed on E8 Signature 

- First payout can be requested in as little as 3 days 

- NinjaTrader and Tradovate support added for serious futures traders 

- MetaTrader support so you can keep your preferred workflow in Forex 

- You can now pay with crypto on futures plans 

- New pricing for E8 Signature: one-time fee, 25% discount window, no activation fee, no monthly bleed

It technically worked. But it felt like a **hoop-jumping gauntlet**. So we shut that down.



Signature is now a true one-step model:



Signature SimFi™ Challenge → Performance → Discretionary Payouts



One path. One ruleset. One clear runway.



We also removed:

• **Activation fees **– no more “you passed, now pay again.”

• **Monthly fees** – no slow drip just to stay in the program.



Less friction. 

Less noise. 

Less mental overhead in a game that already has plenty.



###The upgrades that actually matter to you





Here’s what’s live right now in the new E8 Signature:





- **News trading allowed**

You can now trade around news events under the ... [truncated if too long]
