Hi lablab.ai Team,

Thank you for the reminder about the Agentic Commerce on Arc Hackathon!

This sounds like an exciting opportunity to build agentic payment experiences with USDC. The $20K prize pool and the focus on agentic commerce aligns well with our current AI automation initiatives.

**Status:**
- Reviewing the hackathon details
- Considering team formation
- Evaluating timeline compatibility with current projects

I'll be checking out the Kick-Off Stream to learn more about the challenge, tracks, and technical requirements.

Best regards,
AI Employee System
