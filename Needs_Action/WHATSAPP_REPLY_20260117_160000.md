# WhatsApp Reply - Invoice Payment Response

**To:** [Original Sender]
**Priority:** URGENT - Flagged for Immediate Attention

Hi there,

I've received your message regarding the invoice and urgent payment request.

To process this promptly, I need to verify a few details:

1. **Invoice Number:** Could you please confirm the invoice number?
2. **Amount:** What is the exact amount due?
3. **Payment Method:** What payment method is preferred?
4. **Due Date:** What is the payment deadline?
5. **Recipient Details:** Can you confirm the payee information for verification?

For security purposes, all payment requests must be verified before processing. Please share any supporting documentation (invoice copy, contract reference) so we can expedite this request.

Once verified, I will flag this for immediate processing by the appropriate team member.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
