## Facebook Platform Characteristics

### Audience Profile
- **Demographics:** Broad age range (25-65+), family-oriented
- **Behavior:** Community engagement, groups, event discovery
- **Mindset:** Social connection, information sharing, discussions
- **Best Use:** Community building, local business, longer storytelling

### Content Performance Insights
- **Text Posts:** Perform well if conversation-starting
- **Image Posts:** 2.3x more engagement than text-only
- **Video Posts:** 5x more engagement (native video preferred over links)
- **Link Posts:** Lower reach (algorithm de-prioritizes external links)

---

## Facebook Best Practices

### Optimal Post Length
- **Sweet Spot:** 40-80 words
- **Acceptable Range:** 100-250 words for storytelling
- **Limit:** 63,206 characters (but brevity wins)

**Why?** Facebook users scroll fast. Concise posts with clear value get more engagement.

### Hashtag Usage
- **Recommended:** 0-2 hashtags
- **Unlike Instagram:** Hashtags don't significantly boost reach
- **When to Use:** Branded hashtags, event hashtags, trending topics

**Facebook's Algorithm Prioritizes:**
1. Meaningful interactions (comments, shares)
2. Friends and family content
3. Video content (especially live)
4. Recency (post timing matters)

## Facebook Post Templates

### Template 1: Community Question

**Purpose:** Spark discussion, increase comments, build community

**Structure:**
```
[Relatable statement or observation]

[Context - why you're asking]

[Question that requires more than yes/no]

What's your experience? Share in the comments! 👇
```

**Example:**
```
Running a business means wearing multiple hats - some days we're the CEO, designer, accountant, and customer support all in one.

After 3 years of freelancing, I've learned that juggling everything solo isn't sustainable.

What's the first task you outsourced or automated in your business, and how did it change things for you?

Drop your stories below - we can all learn from each other! 💬
```

**When to Use:** Weekly engagement post, building community connection

---

### Template 2: Behind-the-Scenes

**Purpose:** Humanize brand, show process, build authenticity

**Structure:**
```
[Hook - interesting aspect of your work]

[What's happening - 2-3 sentences]

[Insight or lesson learned]

[Optional: Question to engage]
```

**Example:**
```
This is what Monday mornings look like at our home office. ☕️

We start every week by reviewing our priorities, blocking deep work time, and prepping our AI assistant to handle routine tasks. It's not glamorous, but these 30 minutes save us 10+ hours during the week.

Automation isn't about replacing the work we love - it's about creating space for it.

How do you structure your week for maximum impact?
```

**When to Use:** Weekly "day in the life" content, process transparency

---

### Template 3: Milestone Celebration (With Community Appreciation)

**Purpose:** Share achievements while acknowledging community support

**Structure:**
```
[Exciting announcement with emotion]

[The milestone or achievement]

[Gratitude to community/clients]

[What's next or invitation to celebrate]
```

**Example:**
```
We just hit a milestone that felt impossible 12 months ago! 🎉

Our 100th client project went live this week. From web design to brand identity to automation systems, every single project taught us something new.

None of this happens without you - our clients who trust us, our community who supports us, and everyone who's shared our work.

Here's to the next 100. Thank you for being part of this journey! 🙏

What milestone are YOU celebrating this week? Big or small, we want to hear about it!
```

**When to Use:** Major achievements, anniversaries, significant business moments

---

### Template 4: Value Share / Tip

**Purpose:** Position as helpful expert, provide actionable advice

**Structure:**
```
[Problem statement - something your audience struggles with]

[Quick tip or insight - 2-3 sentences]

[How it helps or why it matters]

[Call-to-action: Save/Share/Comment]
```

**Example:**
```
Spending hours every week on repetitive admin tasks? You're not alone.

Here's what changed the game for us: We identified our 5 most repetitive tasks (email replies, invoice creation, social media scheduling, file organization, task tracking) and automated 4 of them using Claude Code and simple Python scripts.

Result: 12 hours back every week to focus on client work and business growth.

What task would you automate first if you could? Drop a comment - I might share our setup! 💡
```

**When to Use:** Educational content, thought leadership, problem-solving

---

### Template 5: Event or Announcement

**Purpose:** Share time-sensitive information, drive specific actions

**Structure:**
```
[Clear announcement or news]

[Key details - what, when, where, why]

[Action item - what they should do]

[Link or next steps]
```

**Example:**
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- **Conversational:** Write like you're talking to a friend
- **Inclusive:** Use "we" and "our" to build community
- **Authentic:** Share real experiences, not just wins
- **Helpful:** Focus on value for the reader

### Formatting for Readability
```
Use line breaks every 2-3 sentences.

This makes posts easier to scan.

Mobile users (80% of Facebook) especially appreciate white space.
```

### Emoji Usage
- **Amount:** 1-3 per post maximum
- **Placement:** Usually at end of sentences or as bullet points
- **Purpose:** Add personality, not distraction
- **Acceptable:** ✅ 💡 🚀 🎉 💬 📢 👇 ⚡ 🙏
- **Avoid:** Overuse, unprofessional emojis, emoji spam

### Calls-to-Action (CTAs)
**Strong CTAs:**
- "What's your experience? Share below!"
- "Drop a comment if you want to see our setup"
- "Tag a friend who needs to hear this"
- "Save this for later when you're ready to automate"

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Like if you agree" (low effort, doesn't boost reach)
- "Click the link" (algorithm penalties)
- No CTA at all

---

## Engagement Optimization

### Best Posting Times
Based on business/professional audience:
- **Peak Days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Peak Times:** 1:00 PM - 4:00 PM (lunch/afternoon break)
- **Weekend Sweet Spot:** Saturday 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
- **Avoid:** Early mornings (< 9 AM), late evenings (> 9 PM)

### Boosting Engagement
1. **Ask Questions:** Posts with questions get 100% more comments
2. **Respond Fast:** Reply to comments within first hour
3. **Tag Relevant People:** When appropriate (not spammy)
4. **Use Native Features:** Facebook Live, Stories get priority
5. **Encourage Shares:** "Tag someone who..." performs well

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Clickbait headlines
- ❌ Engagement bait ("Like for X, Comment for Y")
- ❌ Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- ❌ External links in main text (use first comment instead)
- ❌ Controversial/political content (unless brand-aligned)
- ❌ All-caps text (looks aggressive)

- 10% Promotional (services, offers, announcements)

**Posting Frequency:**
- **Minimum:** 2x per week (maintain presence)
- **Optimal:** 3-5x per week (balanced consistency)
- **Maximum:** 7x per week (daily, but risks fatigue)
